        Log.i("manager", "countSalary:4000");// so i have to write something here 
    }// as well as here , never mind 
    //writting comment is a good thing 
    //comments would make code easier to read
    // code is a good why of describing the things 
    // really  i don't know what i am talking about
    //override is the same method that we use in the employe but with bifferent code or jop
    //child class cuz of extends
